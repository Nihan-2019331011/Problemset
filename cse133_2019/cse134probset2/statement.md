Kas and Nas are two friends. They study in the same school and same class. They love prime numbers. They always want to sit very close to each other and at prime positions. More formally if Kas sits at ***i<sup>th</sup>*** bench and Nas sits at ***j<sup>th</sup>*** bench then ***i ≠ j ,*** **i , j** must be prime and  **|i-j| ≤ 2** these conditions must be maintained.     
You have to determine how many ways they can sit in the class.
#### Input   
The first line contains an integer ***t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10<sup>3</sup>)*** — the number of test cases.    
Each of the following t lines contain an integer  ***n(1 ≤ n ≤ 10<sup>5</sup>)*** representing the number of benches in the class.

#### Output    
Print a single integer **m** - representing the number of ways they can sit.
