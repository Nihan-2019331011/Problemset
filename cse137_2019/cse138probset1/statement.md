You are given ***n*** straight lines parallel to ***x*** axis and also given their start and end points ***(x<sub>1i</sub>, x<sub>2i</sub> and x<sub>1i</sub> ≠
 x<sub>2i</sub>)***.<br>
You have to determine the point where maximum number of lines intersect. In the case of multiple possible solutions, print the solution with minimum **x** .    
#### Input   
The first line contains an integer ***n (1≤n≤10<sup>5</sup>)*** — the number of straight lines.    
Each of the following n lines contain two integers  ***x<sub>1</sub>*** and **x<sub>2</sub>, (10<sup>-6</sup> ≤ x<sub>1</sub>, x<sub>2 </sub> ≤ 10<sup>6</sup>)** representing starting and end point (respectively) of each line.

#### Output    
Print two integer numbers separated by blank character, **x**  — the point with a maximum number of intersection and **m**  — the number of intersection at the point.

In the case of multiple possible solutions, print the solution with minimum **x** .
